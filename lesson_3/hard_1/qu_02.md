# Question 2

What is the result of the last line in the code below?

```Ruby
greetings = { a: 'hi' }
informal_greeting = greetings[:a]
informal_greeting << ' there'

puts informal_greeting  #  => "hi there"
puts greetings
```

Solution:
`{ a: 'hi there' }`
The `variable informal_greeting` and `greeting[:a]` both point to the same String object.  Because the `<<` method called on line 9 modifies this original object, both the value of informal_greeting and greetings[:a] are now equal to `hi there`.
