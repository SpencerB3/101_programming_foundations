# Question 2

The result of the following statement will be an error:

`puts "the value of 40 + 2 is " + (40 + 2)`

Why is this and what are two possible ways to fix this?

The result is an error because one cannot combine a String Object with a Number Object.

Two solutions:

```Ruby
# string interpolation
puts "the value of 40 + 2 is #{40 + 2}"

#convert Number to string
puts "the value of 40 + 2 is " + (40 + 2).to_s
```
