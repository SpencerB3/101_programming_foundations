# Question 2

Let's look at object id's again from the perspective of a method call instead of a block.

Here we haven't changed ANY of the code outside or inside of the block/method. We simply took the contents of the block from the previous practice problem and moved it to a method, to which we are passing all of our outer variables.

Predict how the values and object ids will change throughout the flow of the code below:

```Ruby
def fun_with_ids
  a_outer = 42
  b_outer = "forty two"
  c_outer = [42]
  d_outer = c_outer[0]

  a_outer_id = a_outer.object_id
  b_outer_id = b_outer.object_id
  c_outer_id = c_outer.object_id
  d_outer_id = d_outer.object_id

  puts "a_outer is #{a_outer} with an id of: #{a_outer_id} before the block."
  puts "b_outer is #{b_outer} with an id of: #{b_outer_id} before the block."
  puts "c_outer is #{c_outer} with an id of: #{c_outer_id} before the block."
  puts "d_outer is #{d_outer} with an id of: #{d_outer_id} before the block."
  puts

  an_illustrative_method(a_outer, b_outer, c_outer, d_outer, a_outer_id, b_outer_id, c_outer_id, d_outer_id)


  puts "a_outer is #{a_outer} with an id of: #{a_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{a_outer.object_id} AFTER the method call."
  puts "b_outer is #{b_outer} with an id of: #{b_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{b_outer.object_id} AFTER the method call."
  puts "c_outer is #{c_outer} with an id of: #{c_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{c_outer.object_id} AFTER the method call."
  puts "d_outer is #{d_outer} with an id of: #{d_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{d_outer.object_id} AFTER the method call."
  puts

  puts "a_inner is #{a_inner} with an id of: #{a_inner_id} INSIDE and: #{a_inner.object_id} AFTER the method." rescue puts "ugh ohhhhh"
  puts "b_inner is #{b_inner} with an id of: #{b_inner_id} INSIDE and: #{b_inner.object_id} AFTER the method." rescue puts "ugh ohhhhh"
  puts "c_inner is #{c_inner} with an id of: #{c_inner_id} INSIDE and: #{c_inner.object_id} AFTER the method." rescue puts "ugh ohhhhh"
  puts "d_inner is #{d_inner} with an id of: #{d_inner_id} INSIDE and: #{d_inner.object_id} AFTER the method." rescue puts "ugh ohhhhh"
  puts
end


def an_illustrative_method(a_outer, b_outer, c_outer, d_outer, a_outer_id, b_outer_id, c_outer_id, d_outer_id)
  a_outer_inner_id = a_outer.object_id
  b_outer_inner_id = b_outer.object_id
  c_outer_inner_id = c_outer.object_id
  d_outer_inner_id = d_outer.object_id

  puts "a_outer id was #{a_outer_id} before the method and is: #{a_outer.object_id} inside the method."
  puts "b_outer id was #{b_outer_id} before the method and is: #{b_outer.object_id} inside the method."
  puts "c_outer id was #{c_outer_id} before the method and is: #{c_outer.object_id} inside the method."
  puts "d_outer id was #{d_outer_id} before the method and is: #{d_outer.object_id} inside the method."
  puts

  a_outer = 22
  b_outer = "thirty three"
  c_outer = [44]
  d_outer = c_outer[0]

  puts "a_outer inside after reassignment is #{a_outer} with an id of: #{a_outer_id} before and: #{a_outer.object_id} after."
  puts "b_outer inside after reassignment is #{b_outer} with an id of: #{b_outer_id} before and: #{b_outer.object_id} after."
  puts "c_outer inside after reassignment is #{c_outer} with an id of: #{c_outer_id} before and: #{c_outer.object_id} after."
  puts "d_outer inside after reassignment is #{d_outer} with an id of: #{d_outer_id} before and: #{d_outer.object_id} after."
  puts

  a_inner = a_outer
  b_inner = b_outer
  c_inner = c_outer
  d_inner = c_inner[0]

  a_inner_id = a_inner.object_id
  b_inner_id = b_inner.object_id
  c_inner_id = c_inner.object_id
  d_inner_id = d_inner.object_id

  puts "a_inner is #{a_inner} with an id of: #{a_inner_id} inside the method (compared to #{a_outer.object_id} for outer)."
  puts "b_inner is #{b_inner} with an id of: #{b_inner_id} inside the method (compared to #{b_outer.object_id} for outer)."
  puts "c_inner is #{c_inner} with an id of: #{c_inner_id} inside the method (compared to #{c_outer.object_id} for outer)."
  puts "d_inner is #{d_inner} with an id of: #{d_inner_id} inside the method (compared to #{d_outer.object_id} for outer)."
  puts
end
```

Analysis of Code

# 1 - Before the Method Call

```Ruby
  a_outer = 42
  b_outer = "forty two"
  c_outer = [42]
  d_outer = c_outer[0]

  a_outer_id = a_outer.object_id
  b_outer_id = b_outer.object_id
  c_outer_id = c_outer.object_id
  d_outer_id = d_outer.object_id

  puts "a_outer is #{a_outer} with an id of: #{a_outer_id} before the block."
  puts "b_outer is #{b_outer} with an id of: #{b_outer_id} before the block."
  puts "c_outer is #{c_outer} with an id of: #{c_outer_id} before the block."
  puts "d_outer is #{d_outer} with an id of: #{d_outer_id} before the block."
```

Operates in the same manner as the first question.

```Ruby
a_outer is 42 with an id of: 85 before the block.
b_outer is forty two with an id of: 2152753560 before the block.
c_outer is [42] with an id of: 2152753540 before the block.
d_outer is 42 with an id of: 85 before the block.
```

# 2 - Inside the Method (Jump to Line 35)

```Ruby
def an_illustrative_method(a_outer, b_outer, c_outer, d_outer, a_outer_id, b_outer_id, c_outer_id, d_outer_id)
  a_outer_inner_id = a_outer.object_id
  b_outer_inner_id = b_outer.object_id
  c_outer_inner_id = c_outer.object_id
  d_outer_inner_id = d_outer.object_id

  puts "a_outer id was #{a_outer_id} before the method and is: #{a_outer.object_id} inside the method."
  puts "b_outer id was #{b_outer_id} before the method and is: #{b_outer.object_id} inside the method."
  puts "c_outer id was #{c_outer_id} before the method and is: #{c_outer.object_id} inside the method."
  puts "d_outer id was #{d_outer_id} before the method and is: #{d_outer.object_id} inside the method."
```

Again, same as last question.

```Ruby
a_outer id was 85 before the method and is: 85 inside the method.
b_outer id was 2152753560 before the method and is: 2152753560 inside the method.
c_outer id was 2152753540 before the method and is: 2152753540 inside the method.
d_outer id was 85 before the method and is: 85 inside the method.
```

# 3 - After Reassignment 

```Ruby
  a_outer = 22
  b_outer = "thirty three"
  c_outer = [44]
  d_outer = c_outer[0]

  puts "a_outer inside after reassignment is #{a_outer} with an id of: #{a_outer_id} before and: #{a_outer.object_id} after."
  puts "b_outer inside after reassignment is #{b_outer} with an id of: #{b_outer_id} before and: #{b_outer.object_id} after."
  puts "c_outer inside after reassignment is #{c_outer} with an id of: #{c_outer_id} before and: #{c_outer.object_id} after."
  puts "d_outer inside after reassignment is #{d_outer} with an id of: #{d_outer_id} before and: #{d_outer.object_id} after."
```

After reassigning new values to the `x_outer` variables, the variables now point to different `object_id` from `x_outer_id`.

```Ruby
a_outer inside after reassignment is 22 with an id of: 85 before and: 45 after.
b_outer inside after reassignment is thirty three with an id of: 70334925709820 before and: 70334925749980 after.
c_outer inside after reassignment is [44] with an id of: 70334925709800 before and: 70334925749960 after.
d_outer inside after reassignment is 44 with an id of: 85 before and: 89 after.
```

# 4 - Inside the Method

```Ruby
  a_inner = a_outer
  b_inner = b_outer
  c_inner = c_outer
  d_inner = c_inner[0]

  a_inner_id = a_inner.object_id
  b_inner_id = b_inner.object_id
  c_inner_id = c_inner.object_id
  d_inner_id = d_inner.object_id

  puts "a_inner is #{a_inner} with an id of: #{a_inner_id} inside the method (compared to #{a_outer.object_id} for outer)."
  puts "b_inner is #{b_inner} with an id of: #{b_inner_id} inside the method (compared to #{b_outer.object_id} for outer)."
  puts "c_inner is #{c_inner} with an id of: #{c_inner_id} inside the method (compared to #{c_outer.object_id} for outer)."
  puts "d_inner is #{d_inner} with an id of: #{d_inner_id} inside the method (compared to #{d_outer.object_id} for outer)."
```

The four new variables `x_inner`, being assigned the value of `x_outer`, point to the same `object_id` as `x_outer.object_id` from the last step.

```Ruby
  a_inner is 22 with an id of: 45 inside the method (compared to 45 for outer).
  b_inner is thirty three with an id of: 2152752300 inside the method (compared to 2152752300 for outer).
  c_inner is [44] with an id of: 2152752280 inside the method (compared to 2152752280 for outer).
  d_inner is 44 with an id of: 89 inside the method (compared to 89 for outer).
```

# 5 Outside the Method (Jump to Line 21)

```Ruby
  puts "a_outer is #{a_outer} with an id of: #{a_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{a_outer.object_id} AFTER the method call."
  puts "b_outer is #{b_outer} with an id of: #{b_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{b_outer.object_id} AFTER the method call."
  puts "c_outer is #{c_outer} with an id of: #{c_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{c_outer.object_id} AFTER the method call."
  puts "d_outer is #{d_outer} with an id of: #{d_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{d_outer.object_id} AFTER the method call."
  puts

  puts "a_inner is #{a_inner} with an id of: #{a_inner_id} INSIDE and: #{a_inner.object_id} AFTER the method." rescue puts "ugh ohhhhh"
  puts "b_inner is #{b_inner} with an id of: #{b_inner_id} INSIDE and: #{b_inner.object_id} AFTER the method." rescue puts "ugh ohhhhh"
  puts "c_inner is #{c_inner} with an id of: #{c_inner_id} INSIDE and: #{c_inner.object_id} AFTER the method." rescue puts "ugh ohhhhh"
  puts "d_inner is #{d_inner} with an id of: #{d_inner_id} INSIDE and: #{d_inner.object_id} AFTER the method." rescue puts "ugh ohhhhh"
```

  Here we see the main difference between this example and that of the prior question: the reassignment of the `x_outer` variaables within the method `an_illustrative_method` did not alter their value nor `object_id` even after the method call.

  And the first method does not have access to the variables defined in the nested method.

```Ruby
a_outer is 42 with an id of: 85 BEFORE and: 85 AFTER the method call.
b_outer is forty two with an id of: 70334925709820 BEFORE and: 70334925709820 AFTER the method call.
c_outer is [42] with an id of: 70334925709800 BEFORE and: 70334925709800 AFTER the method call.
d_outer is 42 with an id of: 85 BEFORE and: 85 AFTER the method call.

ugh ohhhhh
ugh ohhhhh
ugh ohhhhh
ugh ohhhhh
```
