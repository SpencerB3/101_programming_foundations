# Question 1

Every named entity in Ruby has an object_id. This is a unique identifier for that object.

It is often the case that two different things "look the same", but they can be different objects. The "under the hood" object referred to by a particular named-variable can change depending on what is done to that named-variable.

In other words, in Ruby everything is an object...but it is not always THE SAME object.

Predict how the values and object ids will change throughout the flow of the code below:

```Ruby
def fun_with_ids
  a_outer = 42
  b_outer = "forty two"
  c_outer = [42]
  d_outer = c_outer[0]

  a_outer_id = a_outer.object_id
  b_outer_id = b_outer.object_id
  c_outer_id = c_outer.object_id
  d_outer_id = d_outer.object_id

  puts "a_outer is #{a_outer} with an id of: #{a_outer_id} before the block."
  puts "b_outer is #{b_outer} with an id of: #{b_outer_id} before the block."
  puts "c_outer is #{c_outer} with an id of: #{c_outer_id} before the block."
  puts "d_outer is #{d_outer} with an id of: #{d_outer_id} before the block."
  puts

  1.times do
    a_outer_inner_id = a_outer.object_id
    b_outer_inner_id = b_outer.object_id
    c_outer_inner_id = c_outer.object_id
    d_outer_inner_id = d_outer.object_id

    puts "a_outer id was #{a_outer_id} before the block and is: #{a_outer_inner_id} inside the block."
    puts "b_outer id was #{b_outer_id} before the block and is: #{b_outer_inner_id} inside the block."
    puts "c_outer id was #{c_outer_id} before the block and is: #{c_outer_inner_id} inside the block."
    puts "d_outer id was #{d_outer_id} before the block and is: #{d_outer_inner_id} inside the block."
    puts

    a_outer = 22
    b_outer = "thirty three"
    c_outer = [44]
    d_outer = c_outer[0]

    puts "a_outer inside after reassignment is #{a_outer} with an id of: #{a_outer_id} before and: #{a_outer.object_id} after."
    puts "b_outer inside after reassignment is #{b_outer} with an id of: #{b_outer_id} before and: #{b_outer.object_id} after."
    puts "c_outer inside after reassignment is #{c_outer} with an id of: #{c_outer_id} before and: #{c_outer.object_id} after."
    puts "d_outer inside after reassignment is #{d_outer} with an id of: #{d_outer_id} before and: #{d_outer.object_id} after."
    puts


    a_inner = a_outer
    b_inner = b_outer
    c_inner = c_outer
    d_inner = c_inner[0]

    a_inner_id = a_inner.object_id
    b_inner_id = b_inner.object_id
    c_inner_id = c_inner.object_id
    d_inner_id = d_inner.object_id

    puts "a_inner is #{a_inner} with an id of: #{a_inner_id} inside the block (compared to #{a_outer.object_id} for outer)."
    puts "b_inner is #{b_inner} with an id of: #{b_inner_id} inside the block (compared to #{b_outer.object_id} for outer)."
    puts "c_inner is #{c_inner} with an id of: #{c_inner_id} inside the block (compared to #{c_outer.object_id} for outer)."
    puts "d_inner is #{d_inner} with an id of: #{d_inner_id} inside the block (compared to #{d_outer.object_id} for outer)."
    puts
  end

  puts "a_outer is #{a_outer} with an id of: #{a_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{a_outer.object_id} AFTER the block."
  puts "b_outer is #{b_outer} with an id of: #{b_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{b_outer.object_id} AFTER the block."
  puts "c_outer is #{c_outer} with an id of: #{c_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{c_outer.object_id} AFTER the block."
  puts "d_outer is #{d_outer} with an id of: #{d_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{d_outer.object_id} AFTER the block."
  puts

  puts "a_inner is #{a_inner} with an id of: #{a_inner_id} INSIDE and: #{a_inner.object_id} AFTER the block." rescue puts "ugh ohhhhh"
  puts "b_inner is #{b_inner} with an id of: #{b_inner_id} INSIDE and: #{b_inner.object_id} AFTER the block." rescue puts "ugh ohhhhh"
  puts "c_inner is #{c_inner} with an id of: #{c_inner_id} INSIDE and: #{c_inner.object_id} AFTER the block." rescue puts "ugh ohhhhh"
  puts "d_inner is #{d_inner} with an id of: #{d_inner_id} INSIDE and: #{d_inner.object_id} AFTER the block." rescue puts "ugh ohhhhh"
end
```

Analysis of Code

# 1 - Before the Block

```Ruby
def fun_with_ids
  a_outer = 42
  b_outer = "forty two"
  c_outer = [42]
  d_outer = c_outer[0]

  a_outer_id = a_outer.object_id
  b_outer_id = b_outer.object_id
  c_outer_id = c_outer.object_id
  d_outer_id = d_outer.object_id

  puts "a_outer is #{a_outer} with an id of: #{a_outer_id} before the block."
  puts "b_outer is #{b_outer} with an id of: #{b_outer_id} before the block."
  puts "c_outer is #{c_outer} with an id of: #{c_outer_id} before the block."
  puts "d_outer is #{d_outer} with an id of: #{d_outer_id} before the block."
```
The `object_id` of both `a_outer` and `d_outer` will be the same.

Output:

```Ruby
a_outer is 42 with an id of: 85 before the block.
b_outer is forty two with an id of: 70301056914660 before the block.
c_outer is [42] with an id of: 70301056914640 before the block.
d_outer is 42 with an id of: 85 before the block.
```

# 2 - Inside the Block

```Ruby
  1.times do
    a_outer_inner_id = a_outer.object_id
    b_outer_inner_id = b_outer.object_id
    c_outer_inner_id = c_outer.object_id
    d_outer_inner_id = d_outer.object_id

    puts "a_outer id was #{a_outer_id} before the block and is: #{a_outer_inner_id} inside the block."
    puts "b_outer id was #{b_outer_id} before the block and is: #{b_outer_inner_id} inside the block."
    puts "c_outer id was #{c_outer_id} before the block and is: #{c_outer_inner_id} inside the block."
    puts "d_outer id was #{d_outer_id} before the block and is: #{d_outer_inner_id} inside the block."
```

Because these new variables `x_outer_inner_id` have been assigned to the same objects as the previous variable `x_outer_id`, and because the inner scope of these variables should be able to access the outer scope, the `object_id` inside the block should be the unaltered from the outside the block.

Output:

```Ruby
a_outer id was 85 before the block and is: 85 inside the block.
b_outer id was 70301056914660 before the block and is: 70301056914660 inside the block.
c_outer id was 70301056914640 before the block and is: 70301056914640 inside the block.
d_outer id was 85 before the block and is: 85 inside the block.
```

# 3 - Reassignment Inside Block

```Ruby
    a_outer = 22
    b_outer = "thirty three"
    c_outer = [44]
    d_outer = c_outer[0]

    puts "a_outer inside after reassignment is #{a_outer} with an id of: #{a_outer_id} before and: #{a_outer.object_id} after."
    puts "b_outer inside after reassignment is #{b_outer} with an id of: #{b_outer_id} before and: #{b_outer.object_id} after."
    puts "c_outer inside after reassignment is #{c_outer} with an id of: #{c_outer_id} before and: #{c_outer.object_id} after."
    puts "d_outer inside after reassignment is #{d_outer} with an id of: #{d_outer_id} before and: #{d_outer.object_id} after."
```

  Because all the variables have been reassigned to new values, these variables will now point towards a new id.  The `object_id` for the objects outside are still the same

Output:

```Ruby
a_outer inside after reassignment is 22 with an id of: 85 before and: 45 after.
b_outer inside after reassignment is thirty three with an id of: 70301056914660 before and: 70301056913900 after.
c_outer inside after reassignment is [44] with an id of: 70301056914640 before and: 70301056913880 after.
d_outer inside after reassignment is 44 with an id of: 85 before and: 89 after.
```

# 4 - Inside the Block

```Ruby
    a_inner = a_outer
    b_inner = b_outer
    c_inner = c_outer
    d_inner = c_inner[0]

    a_inner_id = a_inner.object_id
    b_inner_id = b_inner.object_id
    c_inner_id = c_inner.object_id
    d_inner_id = d_inner.object_id

    puts "a_inner is #{a_inner} with an id of: #{a_inner_id} inside the block (compared to #{a_outer.object_id} for outer)."
    puts "b_inner is #{b_inner} with an id of: #{b_inner_id} inside the block (compared to #{b_outer.object_id} for outer)."
    puts "c_inner is #{c_inner} with an id of: #{c_inner_id} inside the block (compared to #{c_outer.object_id} for outer)."
    puts "d_inner is #{d_inner} with an id of: #{d_inner_id} inside the block (compared to #{d_outer.object_id} for outer)."
```
  The `x_inner` variables have been reassigned to their `x_outer` counterparts, and they should therefore share the same id with `x_outer.object_id` as we are still inside the block.

Result:

```Ruby
a_inner is 22 with an id of: 45 inside the block (compared to 45 for outer).
b_inner is thirty three with an id of: 70301056913900 inside the block (compared to 70301056913900 for outer).
c_inner is [44] with an id of: 70301056913880 inside the block (compared to 70301056913880 for outer).
d_inner is 44 with an id of: 89 inside the block (compared to 89 for outer).
```

# 5 - Outside the Block

```Ruby
  puts "a_outer is #{a_outer} with an id of: #{a_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{a_outer.object_id} AFTER the block."
  puts "b_outer is #{b_outer} with an id of: #{b_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{b_outer.object_id} AFTER the block."
  puts "c_outer is #{c_outer} with an id of: #{c_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{c_outer.object_id} AFTER the block."
  puts "d_outer is #{d_outer} with an id of: #{d_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{d_outer.object_id} AFTER the block."
  puts

  puts "a_inner is #{a_inner} with an id of: #{a_inner_id} INSIDE and: #{a_inner.object_id} AFTER the block." rescue puts "ugh ohhhhh"
  puts "b_inner is #{b_inner} with an id of: #{b_inner_id} INSIDE and: #{b_inner.object_id} AFTER the block." rescue puts "ugh ohhhhh"
  puts "c_inner is #{c_inner} with an id of: #{c_inner_id} INSIDE and: #{c_inner.object_id} AFTER the block." rescue puts "ugh ohhhhh"
  puts "d_inner is #{d_inner} with an id of: #{d_inner_id} INSIDE and: #{d_inner.object_id} AFTER the block." rescue puts "ugh ohhhhh"
  ```

The variables `x_outer` have been reassigned in the block and the reassigment still holds outside the block.  The `x_outer_id` remains the same value as before the block was run.

The variables initialized inside the block are not recognized outside the block.


  Result:

  ```Ruby
a_outer is 22 with an id of: 85 BEFORE and: 45 AFTER the block.
b_outer is thirty three with an id of: 70282124063920 BEFORE and: 70282124063160 AFTER the block.
c_outer is [44] with an id of: 70282124063900 BEFORE and: 70282124063140 AFTER the block.
d_outer is 44 with an id of: 85 BEFORE and: 89 AFTER the block.

ugh ohhhhh
ugh ohhhhh
ugh ohhhhh
ugh ohhhhh
  ```
