# Question 4

To drive that last one home...let's turn the tables and have the string show a modified output, while the array thwarts the method's efforts to modify the caller's version of it.

```Ruby
def tricky_method_two(a_string_param, an_array_param)
  a_string_param << 'rutabaga'
  an_array_param = ['pumpkins', 'rutabaga']
end

my_string = "pumpkins"
my_array = ["pumpkins"]
tricky_method_two(my_string, my_array)

puts "My string looks like this now: #{my_string}"
puts "My array looks like this now: #{my_array}"
```

Answer:
```Ruby
# => "My string looks like this now: pumpkinsrutabaga"
# => "My array looks like this now: ["pumpkins"]"
```

Just as in the prior question, the `<<` operator modifies the String object itself to which both String variables `my_string` and `a_string_param` point.  Hence we see the effect of the `<<` operator outside the method.   The `=` assignment simply re-assigns the variable name to a different Array object, and that reassignmed variable no longer points to the same Array object given as an argument.
