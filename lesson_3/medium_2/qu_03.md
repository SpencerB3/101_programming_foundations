# Question 3

Let's call a method, and pass both a string and an array as parameters and see how even though they are treated in the same way by Ruby, the results can be different.

Study the following code and state what will be displayed...and why:

```Ruby
def tricky_method(a_string_param, an_array_param)
  a_string_param += "rutabaga"
  an_array_param << "rutabaga"
end

my_string = "pumpkins"
my_array = ["pumpkins"]
tricky_method(my_string, my_array)

puts "My string looks like this now: #{my_string}"
puts "My array looks like this now: #{my_array}"
```

Answer:
```Ruby
# => "My string looks like this now: pumpkins"
# => "My array looks like this now: ["pumpkins", "rutabaga"]"
```

The `<<` operator mutates the argument (array or string) and therefore the results of the `tricky_method` can be seen outside of the method.  On the other hand, `+=` is a reassignment and therefore initializes a new `String` object.  The variable inside `tricky_method` now points to another object.
