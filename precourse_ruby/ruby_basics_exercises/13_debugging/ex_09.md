Given a String of digits, our `digit_product` method should return the product of all digits in the String argument. You've been asked to implement this method *without* using [`reduce`](http://ruby-doc.org/core/Enumerable.html#method-i-reduce) or [`inject`](http://ruby-doc.org/core/Enumerable.html#method-i-inject).

When testing the method, you are surprised by a return value of 0. What's wrong with this code and how can you fix it?

```ruby
def digit_product(str_num)
  digits = str_num.chars.map { |n| n.to_i }
  product = 0

  digits.each do |digit|
    product *= digit
  end

  product
end


p digit_product('12345')
# expected return value: 120
# actual return value: 0
```

The problem is that the variable `product` is assigned the value `0` which when used with the `*=` operator will always  return `0`.  We should reassign `product` to reference the value of `1` in order to get the expected return value.
