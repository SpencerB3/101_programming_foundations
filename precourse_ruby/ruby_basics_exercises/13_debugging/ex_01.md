You come across the following code. What errors does it raise for the given examples and what exactly do the error messages mean?

```ruby
def find_first_nonzero_among(numbers)
  numbers.each do |n|
    return n if n.nonzero?
  end
end

# Examples

find_first_nonzero_among(0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0)
find_first_nonzero_among(1)
```

The code above givds the following error:

`ArgumentError (wrong number of arguments (given 6, expected 1))`

and

`NoMethodError (undefined method `each' for 1:Integer)`

This first error message refers to the line `find_first_nonzero_among(0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0)`.  The arguments are given as consecutive arguments whereas the method itself only accepts one argument.  

For the second error, the number of arguments is correct, but the data structure of the argument (Integer) does not work with the `#each`  enumerator inside the method.
