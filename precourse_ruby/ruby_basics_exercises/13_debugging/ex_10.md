We started writing an RPG game, but we already run into an error message. Find the problem and fix it.

```ruby
# Each player starts with the same basic stats.

player = { strength: 10, dexterity: 10, charisma: 10, stamina: 10 }

# Then the player picks a character class and gets an upgrade accordingly.

character_classes = {
  warrior: { strength:  20 },
  thief:   { dexterity: 20 },
  scout:   { stamina:   20 },
  mage:    { charisma:  20 }
}

puts 'Please type your class (warrior, thief, scout, mage):'
input = gets.chomp.downcase

player.merge(character_classes[input])

puts 'Your character stats:'
puts player
```

The first problem is that the data type of the variable `input` (String object) does not match the daata type of the keys in the `character_classes` hash (Symbol object).  We should convert the user input into a Symbol object using the `#to_sym` on the value of the `input` variable (`gets.chomp.downcase.to_sym`).

Another problem with the code above is that the `#merge` method does not modify the player object.  In order to permanently modify the reference value of the variable `player`, we may use the `#merge!` method or we may reassign the variable `player` as in `player= player.merge(character_classes[input])`.
