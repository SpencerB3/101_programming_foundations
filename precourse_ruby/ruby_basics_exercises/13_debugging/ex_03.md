When the user inputs `10`, we expect the program to print `The result is 50!`, but that's not the output we see. Why not?

```ruby
def multiply_by_five(n)
  n * 5
end

puts "Hello! Which number would you like to multiply by 5?"
number = gets.chomp

puts "The result is #{multiply_by_five(number)}!"
```

The output of the code above is not `The result is 50!` because the input on the 5th line of code is a String object rather than an Integer object.  We caan fix the code by running `String#to_i` on the `number` variable.

```ruby
def multiply_by_five(n)
  n * 5
end

puts "Hello! Which number would you like to multiply by 5?"
number = gets.chomp.to_i

puts "The result is #{multiply_by_five(number)}!"
```
