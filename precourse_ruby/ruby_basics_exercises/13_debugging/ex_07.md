Time for a check of your financial situation.

The output of the code below tells you that you have around $70. However, you expected your bank account to have about $238. What did we do wrong?

```ruby
# Financially, you started the year with a clean slate.

balance = 0

# Here's what you earned and spent during the first three months.

january = {
  income: [ 1200, 75 ],
  expenses: [ 650, 140, 33.2, 100, 26.9, 78 ]
}

february = {
  income: [ 1200 ],
  expenses: [ 650, 140, 320, 46.7, 122.5 ]
}

march = {
  income: [ 1200, 10, 75 ],
  expenses: [ 650, 140, 350, 12, 59.9, 2.5 ]
}

# Let's see how much you've got now...

def calculate_balance(month)
  plus  = month[:income].sum
  minus = month[:expenses].sum

  plus - minus
end

[january, february, march].each do |month|
  balance = calculate_balance(month)
end

puts balance
```

The vaariable `balance` returns the amount saved in the month of March rather than over the period of three months.  The variable `balance` is simply reassigned a new value rather than saved and incremented.  We can change it by using the `+=` operator instead of the `=` operator.

```ruby
[january, february, march].each do |month|
  balance += calculate_balance(month)
end
```
