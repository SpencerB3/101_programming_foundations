We want to iterate through the `numbers` array and return a new array containing only the even numbers. However, our code isn't producing the expected output. Why not? How can we change it to produce the expected result?

```ruby
numbers = [5, 2, 9, 6, 3, 1, 8]

even_numbers = numbers.map do |n|
  n if n.even?
end

p even_numbers # expected output: [2, 6, 8]
```

By using the `#map` method, the new array transforms every element based on the return value of each iteration.  `even_numbers` thus equals `[nil, 2, nil, 6, nil, nil, 8]`.  In order to return a new array with just the even numbers selected, we should use the `#select` method.  The `#select` method returns a new array with only the elements of the original array that give a truthy value when passed to the expression in the block.
