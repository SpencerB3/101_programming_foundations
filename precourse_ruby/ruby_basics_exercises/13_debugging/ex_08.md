The following code throws an error. Find out what is wrong and think about how you would fix it.

```ruby
colors = ['red', 'yellow', 'purple', 'green', 'dark blue', 'turquoise', 'silver', 'black']
things = ['pen', 'mouse pad', 'coffee mug', 'sofa', 'surf board', 'training mat', 'notebook']

colors.shuffle!
things.shuffle!

i = 0
loop do
  break if i >= things.length

  if i == 0
    puts 'I have a ' + colors[i] + ' ' + things[i] + '.'
  else
    puts 'And a ' + colors[i] + ' ' + things[i] + '.'
  end

  i += 1
end
```

The problem with the code above is that the `colors` array is longer than the `things` array.  Hence we will get the following error messaage when running this code: `TypeError (no implicit conversion of nil into String)`.

In order to fix the code, we can can set the break condition in the loop to `i >= things.length` so that the counter variable `i` never goes above the length of the `things` array.
