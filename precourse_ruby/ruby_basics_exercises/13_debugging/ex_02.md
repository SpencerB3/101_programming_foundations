Our `predict_weather` method should output a message indicating whether a sunny or cloudy day lies ahead. However, the output is the same every time the method is invoked. Why? Fix the code so that it behaves as expected.

```ruby
def predict_weather
  sunshine = ['true', 'false'].sample

  if sunshine
    puts "Today's weather will be sunny!"
  else
    puts "Today's weather will be cloudy!"
  end
end
```

  The code abov always outputs `"Today's weather will be sunny!"` since the `if` conditional statement tests the truthiness of the `sunshine` variable.  The `sunshine` variable is always truthy since the two possible values are both String objects, not Booleans.  To fix the above code, we will need to change these strings to boolean values.

```ruby
def predict_weather
  sunshine = [true, false].sample

  if sunshine
    puts "Today's weather will be sunny!"
  else
    puts "Today's weather will be cloudy!"
  end
end
```
