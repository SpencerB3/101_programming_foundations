In the previous exercise, you learned that the `while` loop returns `nil` unless `break` is used. Locate the documentation for `break`, and determine what value `break` sets the return value to for the `while` loop.

`break` returns `nil` if no argument is applied.  If an argument is supplied for `break`, that value will be the return value.
