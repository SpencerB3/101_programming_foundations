What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to answer.

```ruby
number = 7

if number
  puts "My favorite number is #{number}."
else
  puts "I don't have a favorite number."
end
```

Since the variable `number` evaluates to `7`, i.e. a truthy value, the code above will always print `My favorite number is 7` to the console.
