What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to answer.

```ruby
def meal
  'Dinner'
  puts 'Dinner'
end

p meal
```

The code above will print

```ruby
'Dinner'
nil
```

The first line is the string `'Dinner'` being printed to the console by the method `#put`. The second line  `Nil` is the return value of the method `meal`.
