What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to answer.

```ruby
def count_sheep
  5.times do |sheep|
    puts sheep
  end
end

puts count_sheep
```

The code above will return

```ruby
0
1
2
3
4
5
```

The last integer, `5`, is the return value of `#times` which always returns the initial integer.  The return value of `#times` is then returned by the method `count_sheep`.
