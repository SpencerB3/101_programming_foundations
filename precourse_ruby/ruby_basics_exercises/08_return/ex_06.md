What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to answer.

```ruby
def meal
  return 'Breakfast'
  'Dinner'
  puts 'Dinner'
end

puts meal
```

The code above will print `'Breakfast'`.  Because the keyword `return` exits the method, all the lines of code ater the explicit `return` statement will not be run.
