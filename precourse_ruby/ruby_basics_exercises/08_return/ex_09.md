What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to answer.

```ruby
def count_sheep
  5.times do |sheep|
    puts sheep
    if sheep >= 2
      return
    end
  end
end

p count_sheep
```

The code above will print to the console

```ruby
0
1
nil
```

After the value of `sheep` equals or exceeds `2` . the `return` keyword inside the `if` statement will end the `#times` method and return `nil`.
