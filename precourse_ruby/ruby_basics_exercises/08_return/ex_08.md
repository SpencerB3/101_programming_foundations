What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to answer.

```ruby
def count_sheep
  5.times do |sheep|
    puts sheep
  end
  10
end

puts count_sheep
```

The code above will print to the console

```ruby
0
1
2
3
4
10
```

In this code, the number `10` is the last number printed to the console since it is implicitedly returned by the method `count_sheep`.
