What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to answer.

```ruby
def meal
  return 'Breakfast'
  'Dinner'
end

puts meal
```

The code above will return `'Breakfast'` since that is the value that follows the keyword `return` in the method `meal`.  The keyword `return` always exits a method.  Anything afterward will not be processed.
