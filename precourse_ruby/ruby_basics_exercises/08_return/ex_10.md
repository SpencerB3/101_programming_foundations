What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to answer.

```ruby
def tricky_number
  if true
    number = 1
  else
    2
  end
end

puts tricky_number
```

The code above will print `1` to the console.  Since the `if`clause of the `if/else` statement will always evaluate to `true`, and variable assignments return the value to which they are assigned, the implicit return value of `tricky_number` is `1`.
