What will the following code print, and why? Don't run the code until you have tried to answer.

```ruby
a = 7

def my_value(b)
  a = b
end

my_value(a + 5)
puts a
```

The code above will print `7` to the console.  The local variable `a` inside `my_value` is not visible outside the method definition.
