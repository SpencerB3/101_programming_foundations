What will the following code print, and why? Don't run the code until you have tried to answer.

```ruby
a = "Xyzzy"

def my_value(b)
  b[2] = '-'
end

my_value(a)
puts a
```

The code above will print `Xy-zy` to the console.  The difference here from the laast exercises is that we are dealing with a String object.  In Ruby, String objects are mutable and `String#[]` is a mutating method.  Since `b` references the same String object as `a`, printing `a` will give the updated value.
