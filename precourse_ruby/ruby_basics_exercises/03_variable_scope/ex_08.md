What will the following code print, and why? Don't run the code until you have tried to answer.

```ruby
array = [1, 2, 3]

array.each do |element|
  a = element
end

puts a
```

The code above will raise an error.  The variable `a` initialized within the `each` block will not be accessible in the outside scope.
