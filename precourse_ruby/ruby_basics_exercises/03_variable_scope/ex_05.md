What will the following code print, and why? Don't run the code until you have tried to answer.

```ruby
a = "Xyzzy"

def my_value(b)
  b = 'yzzyX'
end

my_value(a)
puts a
```

The code above will print Xyzzy to the console.  Since assignment operator `=` never mutates the object that is referenced, the value `a` which references a String object is not mutated when passed into the method `my_value`.
