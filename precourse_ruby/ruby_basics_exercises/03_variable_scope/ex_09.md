What will the following code print, and why? Don't run the code until you have tried to answer.

```ruby
a = 7
array = [1, 2, 3]

array.each do |a|
  a += 1
end

puts a
```

The code abocve will print `7` to the console.  The reason the code above will not print `10` to the console is because the parameter `a` is shadowing  or blocking the external variable `a` from being incremented since they share the same variable name.
