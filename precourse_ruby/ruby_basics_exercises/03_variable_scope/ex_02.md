What will the following code print, and why? Don't run the code until you have tried to answer.

```ruby
a = 7

def my_value(a)
  a += 10
end

my_value(a)
puts a
```

The code above will print `7` to the console.  As in the last exercise, ther `+=` operator does not modify the variable `a`.  The parameter `a` is not visible outside the method `my_value` and does not affect the top-level variable `a`.
