What will the following code print, and why? Don't run the code until you have tried to answer.

```ruby
a = 7
array = [1, 2, 3]

array.each do |element|
  a = element
end

puts a
```

The code above will print `3` to the console.  The variable `a` is accessible within the block of the `each` method.  At each iteration, the `a` variable is reassigned to a sequential element within the array `array`.  The last element to be reassigned to `a` is the value which will be printed out to the console.
