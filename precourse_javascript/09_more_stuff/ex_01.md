What does this code log to the console? Why?

```js
let array1 = [1, 2, 3];
let array2 = array1;
array1[1] = 4;
console.log(array2);
```

The above code will log `[1, 4, 3]`.  Because `array1` and  `array2` are aliases of the same array, the reassignment that took place on line 3, `array1[1] = 4;`, will affect the values of both `array1` and `array2`.
