What does the following function do?

```js
function doSomething(string) {
  return string.split(' ').reverse().map((value) => value.length);
}
```



On line 1, the function above initializes the parameter `string`. On line 2, the function returns the string parameter after a series of chained methods are performed upon it.  First the `split(' ')` method transforms `string` into an array with every `' '`  excluded from the arrays elements as well as where a new element ends and begins (more succinctly: the method returns an array of words).  The `reverse()` method then reverses the order of the elements in the array version of  `string`.  The `map` method then returns a new array where the length of each `value` passed in the method will become its own element in the new array.
