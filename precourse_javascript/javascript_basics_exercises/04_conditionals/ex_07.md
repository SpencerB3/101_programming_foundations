Predict the output of the following code:

```js
if (false || true) {
  console.log('Yes!');
} else {
  console.log('No...');
}
```

The`if` clause of the `if` statement evaluates  `false` and `true` with the OR operator, where only one value needs to be `true` in order for the expression to evaluate to `true`.  This particular expression will always evaluate to `true`, and therefore the `if` statement above will evaluate to logging 'Yes!' to the console.
