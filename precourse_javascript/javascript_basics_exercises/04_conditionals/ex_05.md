Take a look at the code below. Without running it, determine what it will log to the console. If you're not sure, refer to the MDN documentation on `switch` statements.

```js
let animal = 'horse';

switch (animal) {
  case 'duck':
    console.log('quack');
  case 'squirrel':
    console.log('nook nook');
  case 'horse':
    console.log('neigh');
  case 'bird':
    console.log('tweet tweet');
  default:
    console.log('*cricket*');
}
```



  The code above will log the following to the console:

```javascript
'neigh'
'tweet tweet'
'*cricket*'
```

The `switch` statement uses the equality operator to check against the value of `animal` against the values contained in the `case` statements.  Once a `case` statement evaluates to true, the associated block of code is invoked.   Because no `break` statements are used in this `switch` statement, all the associated blocks of code below the initial `case` statement that evaluated to true will be invoked until the `switch` statement ends.  In the example of this `switch` statement, we have a `case` statement that evaluates to `true` at `'horse'` which invokes `console.log` to log `'neigh'`.  Because no `break` statements are used, we also log `'tweet tweet'` and finally `'*crickets*'` to the console.
