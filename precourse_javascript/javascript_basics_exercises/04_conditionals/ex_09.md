Without running the below code, determine what will be logged to the console.

```js
let sale = true;
let admissionPrice = !sale ? 5.25 : 3.99;

console.log('$' + admissionPrice);
```

`$3.99` will be logged to the console.

On the first liine the variable `sale` is initialized and set to the boolean value `true`.

On the second line the variable `admissionPrice` is initalizied and set to the return value of a ternary operator.  The ternary operator's conditional statement evaluates the value of `sale` prepended with the logical not operator `!`.  This operator `!` reverses the truthiness of the value of the variable evaluates.  In this case, the resulting value of `!sale` is `false`.  Because the condition statement of the ternary operator evaluates to false, the second of the two expressions will be invoked and assigned to the variable `admissionPrice`.

In the last line, `$` plus the value of the variable `admissionPrie` (`3.99`) is logged to the console.
