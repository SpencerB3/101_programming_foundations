Determine what the following code snippet logs. First solve it in your head or on paper, and only then run it in your JavaScript console to check the result.

```js
let speed = 0;
let acceleration = 24;
let brakingForce = 19;

let isMoving = brakingForce < acceleration && (speed > 0 || acceleration > 0);

console.log(isMoving);
```

**Bonus question:** Do we need the parentheses in the boolean expression or could we also have written the following?

```js
let isMoving = brakingForce < acceleration && speed > 0 || acceleration > 0;
```

The code snippet above will log `true` to the console.  In the expression to which the variable isMoving is assigned, first the comparison operators have precedence, then the logical AND operator, and finally the logical OR operator comes into play.  Ultimately, the whole expression evaluates to `true`, is then assigned to the variable `isMoving`, and then two lines down the value of `isMoving` is logged to the console.

Yes, we do need the parentheses as `&&` has a higher order of operations than `||`.  Without the parentheses, the `speed > 0` expression would be evaluated by the && operator instead of the `||` operator.
