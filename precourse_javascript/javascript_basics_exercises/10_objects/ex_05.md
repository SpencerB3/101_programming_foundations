Before running any code, determine what difference there will be in the output of the two code snippets below (if any).

Snippet 1:

```js
let ocean = {};
let prefix = 'Indian';

ocean.prefix = 'Pacific';

console.log(ocean); // ?
```

The above code will output ` { prefix: 'Pacific' }`.  The expression on line 4 is initializing both the key `prefix` and the value `Pacific`.  The last line will log them both as a key/value pair in the object `ocean`.

Snippet 2:

```js
let ocean = {};
let prefix = 'Indian';

ocean[prefix] = 'Pacific';

console.log(ocean); // ?
```

The above code will output `{ Indian: 'Pacific' }`.  The reason there is a difference from the first snippet is because the bracket notation at line 4 `ocean[prefix]` (no quotes!) sets the key to  the value of `prefix` from line 2 (`'Indian'`).  When bracket notation is used without quotes, whatever is within the brackets refers to an expression.
