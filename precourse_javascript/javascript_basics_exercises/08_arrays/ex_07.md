Predict the output of the below code. When you run the code, do you see what you expected? Why or why not?

```js
let array1 = [2, 6, 4];
let array2 = [2, 6, 4];

console.log(array1 === array2);
```

The above code will output `false` to the console.  The equality operator  `===`checks whether these two arrays are the same object.  Though they contain the same numerical elements, they refer to different locations of memory hence JavaScript sees them as two different objects.  If we had the following:

```javascript
let array1 = [2, 6, 4];
let array2 = array1;

console.log(array1 === array2);
```

Here we will output `true` to the console.  The two variables are assigned the same array and thus refer to the same object.
