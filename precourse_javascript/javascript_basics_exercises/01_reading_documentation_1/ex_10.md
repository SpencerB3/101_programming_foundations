In your JavaScript console, execute the following two lines of code to check whether their return values differ and if so, how. Take a look at the MDN documentation on equality comparisons to read about how `==` and `===` differ.

```js
'8' == 8; // true
'8' === 8; // false
```

- double equals (`==`) will perform a type conversion when comparing two things, and will handle `NaN`, `-0`, and `+0` specially to conform to IEEE 754 (so `NaN != NaN`, and `-0 == +0`);
- triple equals (`===`) will do the same comparison as double equals (including the special handling for `NaN`, `-0`, and `+0`) but without type conversion; if the types differ, `false` is returned.
