How many arguments does the `Array.prototype.join()` method expect? What happens if you call it with less or more arguments?

The array method `join()` concatenates all elements of an array into a string.  The `Array.prototype.join()` method expects one argument.  If no argument is provided, the `join` method will interpolate ',' between each array element in the new string.  If more than one argument is provided, the `join` method will simply use the first argument and ignore the subsequent ones.
