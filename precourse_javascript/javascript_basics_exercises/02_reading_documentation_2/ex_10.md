Run the following code.

```js
let tweet = 'Woohoo! :-)';

if (tweet.length() > 140) {
  console.log('Tweet is too long!');
}
```

You'll see that it raises an error:

```none
TypeError: tweet.length is not a function
```

Check the documentation of both `TypeError` and `length`, in order to find out what causes the error.

The cause of the error is that `length` is not a method but a string property, and therefore does not use parentheses.

According to MDN, "The `**TypeError**` object represents an error when an operation could not be performed, typically (but not exclusively) when a value is not of the expected type."  

In the case above, the JavaScript engine was asked to treat the `length` property with appended parentheses as a function when `tweet.length` is expected to return a number.
