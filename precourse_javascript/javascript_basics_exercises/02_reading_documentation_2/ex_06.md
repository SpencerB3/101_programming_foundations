The [MDN page for `Date`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) lists two methods to get the year of a date.

```js
let today = new Date();

today.getYear();
today.getFullYear();
```

What is the difference between the two methods and which one should you use?

MDN recommends we use the `Date.prototype.getFullYear()` method.  The `Date.prototype.getFullYear()` method will return the year according to local time (`2019`).  The `Date.prototype.getYear()` is not recommended and has been deprecated.  The method does not return a full year but returns the current year after subtracting the number 1900.  In other words, today's year 2019 would return as `119`.
