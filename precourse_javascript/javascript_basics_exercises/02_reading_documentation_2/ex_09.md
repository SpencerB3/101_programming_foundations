The below code raises a `SyntaxError`. If you run the code, you'll see the following error message:

```none
SyntaxError: Unexpected token &&
```

Find and read the documentation about this error on MDN. Then, fix the code.

```js
let speedLimit = 60;
let currentSpeed = 80;

if ((currentSpeed > speedLimit) && ((currentSpeed - speedLimit) > 5)) {
  console.log('"People are so bad at driving cars ' +
    'that computers don\'t have to be that good to be much better." ' +
    '-- Marc Andreessen');
}
```

To correct the `SyntaxError` raised in the code above, the first line of `if` clause of the `if` statement should have parenetheses wrap the whole statement like so:

`if ((currentSpeed > speedLimit) && (currentSpeed - speedLimit) > 5) {`
