Using the documentation, determine how we can find the largest numeric value that can be represented in JavaScript. Write a line of code that returns this value.

The **`Number.MAX_VALUE`** property represents the maximum numeric value representable in JavaScript.  The `MAX_VALUE` property has a value of approximately `1.79E+308`, or 21024. Values larger than `MAX_VALUE` are represented as [`Infinity`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Infinity).
