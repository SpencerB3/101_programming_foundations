What is the difference between the following two code snippets? Check the MDN documentation on `while` and `do...while`.

```js
let counter = 0;

while (counter > 0) {
  console.log('Woooot!');
  counter -= 1;
}
```

```javscript
let counter = 0;

do {
  console.log('Woooot!');
  counter -= 1;
} while (counter > 0);
```

  In the first snippet, we set a `while` loop with the condition that it will run as long as the variable `counter` (initialized to `0` above) is greater than 0.  There are instructions in the body of this `while` loop, but it does not matter as the conditional statement never evaluates to true as the value of `counter` is never greater than 0.  Thus the contents of the `while` statement are never accessed.

  In the second snippet, we again initalize the `counter` to the value `0`.  We then set a `do/while` loop.  Entering into the `do/while` loop, on the first line we log the string `'Woooot!'` to the console.  On the second line of the body of the `do/while` loop, the value of `counter` is decremented by 1.  Finally, in the next line, stepping out of the block of the `do/while` loop, we encounter the conditional statement where we set that the loop will continue iterating as long as the value of `counter` is greater than 0.  This condition is not returned as true, so the `do/while` loop is exited.

  The difference between these two snippets is that in the `while` loop above, we never iterate through the istructions of the loop since the conditional statement never evaluates to true.  In the second snippet with the `do/while` loop, the body of the loop is run just once (logging `'Woooot!'`), before exiting the loop since the conditional statement found afte executing the block immediately returns false.
