What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until you have tried to answer.

```js
let a = 1;

function myFunction(a) {
  console.log(a);
}

let b = 2;

myFunction(b);
```

The code above will log `2` to the console.  At the last line, the function `myFunction` is called with the variable `b` as its argument.  The `a` found in the function `myFunction` is a parameter of the function, and is not affected by the variable `a` declaraction at the beginning of the code.  Therefore, the value of `b` will be logged to the console.
