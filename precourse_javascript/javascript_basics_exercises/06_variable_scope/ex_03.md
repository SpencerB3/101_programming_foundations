What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until you have tried to answer.

```js
if (true) {
  let myValue = 20;
}

console.log(myValue);
```

This code will log `ReferenceError` to the console.  The assignment of the `let` variable `myValue` which occurs in the `if` statement above is only accessible in the block of the `if` statement.  `let` variables are block scoped.
