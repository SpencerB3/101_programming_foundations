What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until you have tried to answer.

```js
const a = 1;

function myFunction() {
  a = 2;
}

myFunction(a);
```

The code above will log a `TypeError`.  In JavaScript, we cannot reassign a value to a `const` variable as is attempted in  line 4, even if it is in the inner scope of a function.
