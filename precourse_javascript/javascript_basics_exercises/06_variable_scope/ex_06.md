What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until you have tried to answer.

```js
let a = 5;
let b = false;

if (a > 4) {
  let b = true;
}

console.log(b);
```

This code above will log `false` to the console.  At the last line of the code the variable `b` is an argument to `console.log`.  The value of the variable `b` that will be logged is that of the outer scope set at the second line of the code.  The assignment of the variable `b` which occurs in the `if` statement is only accesible within the inner scope of that `if` statement.
