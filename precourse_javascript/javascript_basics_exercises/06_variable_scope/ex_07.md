What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until you have tried to answer.

```js
let a = 1;

function myFunction() {
  console.log(a);
}

myFunction();
```

The code above will log a `1` to the console.  The `let` variable assigned to the value `1` is declared before the function call at the last line, the variable will be accessble within the inner bodyof the function `myFunction`.
