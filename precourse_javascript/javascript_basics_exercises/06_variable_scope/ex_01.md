What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until you have tried to answer.

```js
console.log(greeting);

var greeting = 'Hello world!';
```

This code will log `undefined` to the console.  The variable `greeting` evaluates to `undefined` at the point where it is an argument for `console.log`.  This code does not give a `ReferenceError` since `greeting` is initialized by `var`.  All `var` variables are 'hoisted' to the beginning of the code and initialized to `undefined`.
