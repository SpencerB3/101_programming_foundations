What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until you have tried to answer.

```js
const a = {
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe'
};

function myFunction() {
  a.firstName = 'Jane';
}

myFunction();

console.log(a);
```

The above code will log ` { firstName: 'Jane', lastName: 'Doe' }`.  Although JavaScript does not allow `const` variables to be reassigned, the values of complex abjects (arrays, objects) are still mutable.  Hence no error is raised and the `a` object with a key/value pair of `firstName: 'Jane'` is logged to the console.
