What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until you have tried to answer.

```js
function myFunction() {
  let a = 1;

  if (true) {
    console.log(a);
  }
}

myFunction();
```

This code will log `1` to the console.

On line 1 we declare the function `myFunction`.  On the last line we then call the function `myFunction`.    The program then enters into `myFunction`.  In the first line of the body of the function, we assign the let variable a to the value of 1.  On the third line of the function we set an if statement.  In the if clause of the if statement we evaluate the expression `true`.  Because `true` is truthy, we then run the associated code of that `if` branch which logs the value of `a` to the console.  The `let` variable `a` though declared and assigned outsiee the `if` statement, within the `if` branch.
