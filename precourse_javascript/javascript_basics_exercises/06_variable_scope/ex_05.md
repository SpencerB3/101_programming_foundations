What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until you have tried to answer.

```js
function myFunction() {
  let a = 1;

  if (true) {
    console.log(a);
    let a = 2;
    console.log(a);
  }
}

myFunction();
```

The above code will log `ReferenceError` to the console.  Because `let` variables are block scoped, the declaration of the variable `a` within the `if` statement 'holds' the whole block of that scope.  It exists separately from the `let` variable `a` in the outer scope.  The let variable `a` in the `if` statement is hoisted to the top of the scope but  `let` variables are not accessible before they have been assigned. Therefore, when we try to log `a` to the console it has not been assigned a value, an error is raised.
