What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until you have tried to answer.

```js
console.log(greeting);

let greeting = 'Hello world!';
```

This code will give a `ReferenceError`.  The `greeting` variable has not been initialized at the point in the code where it is an argument for `console.log`.  `let` variables are not accessible before they are declared.
