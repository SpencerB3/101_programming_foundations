Add a `qux` property with value `3` to the `myObj` object we created in the previous exercise. 

`myObj.qux = 3`

Now, examine the following code snippets:

**Snippet 1**

```js
Object.keys(myObj).forEach(function(key) {
  console.log(key);
});
```

**Snippet 2**

```js
for (key in myObj) {
  console.log(key);
}
```

Without running this code, can you determine whether these two snippets produce the same output? Why?

1-  `qux`

2- `qux, foo, bar`

These two sets of code will produce two different output.  In the first case, the output will be `qux` since the `Object.key` is used which will limit the iterations of the `forEach` method to `myObj` without accessing its prototypes contents.  In the second case, with the use of the `for/in`,  the output will include the `key` value in the parent object `myProtoObj` as well as the content of  `myObj` since the `for/in` loop has access to all of `myObj`'s prototypes.
