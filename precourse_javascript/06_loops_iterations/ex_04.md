Does the following code produce an error? Why or why not? What output does this code send to the console?

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 5;) {
  console.log(i += 1);
}
```

The code above logs the following to the console:

```javascript
1
2
3
4
5
```

This code does not produce an error because the incrementation has simply been moved to the body of the `for` loop.  It is equal to writing

```javascript
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i += 1) {
  console.log(i);
}
```
