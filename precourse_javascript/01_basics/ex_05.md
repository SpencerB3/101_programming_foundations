Explain why this code logs '510' instead of 15.

`console.log('5' + 10);`

The code logs `510` rather than `15` because the number `10` is coerced into a String and then appended to the String `'5'`.   Per the solution given, every `+` expression that has a string operand produces a string result no matter what the other operand is.
