What does the following code log to the console, and why?

```javascript
function barCodeScanner(serial) {
  switch (serial) {
    case '123':
      console.log('Product1');
    case '113':
      console.log('Product2');
    case '142':
      console.log('Product3');
    default:
      console.log('Product not found!');
  }
}

barCodeScanner('113');
```

`Product2`, `Product3`, `Product not found!`

Since no `break` statements were used in this `switch` statement, all `console.log` expressions after the first `case` statement which evaluate to `true` will print to the console.
