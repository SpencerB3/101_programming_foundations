The following code causes an infinite loop (a loop that never stops iterating). Why?

```js
let counter = 0;

while (counter = 1) {
  console.log(counter);
  counter += 1;

  if (counter > 2) {
    break;
  }
}
```

The code above causes an infinite loop because at every iteration the variable `counter` is reassigned  to the integer `1`.  Inside the body of the `while` statement, the variable `counter` is  logged to the console, and then on the next line incremented by `1`.  The `while` loop then ends with an `if` statement that allows the code to break ou if `counter` is greater than `1`.  Since the condition is not met, the `while` loop starts again with a reassignment of the `counter` back to `1`.
