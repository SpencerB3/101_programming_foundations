What is exception handling and what problem does it solve?

After JavaScript has raised an error, a user may apply exception handling in order to deal with the error.  Using the `try/catch` statement, exception handling lets the code raise errors in the `try` block, thus allowing the user to isolate and fix the error in a predictable and manageable way.
