What happens when you run the following code? Why?

```js
const NAME = 'Victor';
console.log('Good Morning, ' + NAME);
console.log('Good Afternoon, ' + NAME);
console.log('Good Evening, ' + NAME);

NAME = 'Joe';
console.log('Good Morning, ' + NAME);
console.log('Good Afternoon, ' + NAME);
console.log('Good Evening, ' + NAME);
```

When you run the followiing code, the first three results of the `console.log` method will be printed to the console.  On line 6, `NAME = 'Joe'`, the program will stop and return an error as the reassignment of a constant variable is not permitted in Javascript.
