Will this program produce an error when run? Why or why not?

```js
const FOO = 'bar';
{
  const FOO = 'qux';
}

console.log(FOO);
```

This program will not produce an error.  As in the last exercise, the `const` variable `FOO`  initialized within the block (lines 2-4) is not visible to the global scope.  The value set to `FOO` at the first line of the program (`'bar'`) will be the same value  that is logged to the console at the program's last line.
