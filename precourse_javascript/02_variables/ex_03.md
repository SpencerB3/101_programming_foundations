What happens when you run the following program? Why do we get that result?

```javascript
{
  let foo = 'bar';
}

console.log(foo);
```



When you run the following code, the result is a `ReferenceError` as the variable  `foo` has not been defined in the outer scope.  The variable `foo` has only been defined in the inner scope of the block thaat precedes `console.log`.
