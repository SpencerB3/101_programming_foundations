```js
let foo = 'bar';
{
  let foo = 'qux';
}

console.log(foo);
```

What does this program log to the console? Why?

This program logs the value of the variable `foo` to the console.  On the first line `foo` is assigned to `'bar'` in the global scope of the program.  In the following three lines, a block is created and the variable `foo`  is initialized and  set to the value of `'qux'`.  This initialization and assignment of `foo` is only visible within the inner scope of the block.  Outside the block, the initialization of `foo` and its assignment to `'bar'` still hold.  Therefore, the value `'bar'` is logged to the console at the last line of the program.
