What does this code log to the console? Does executing the `foo` function affect the output? Why or why not?

```js
let bar = 1;
function foo() {
  let bar = 2;
}

foo();
console.log(bar);
```

This code logs `1`  to the console.  The initialization and reassignment of the variable `bar` occurs in the local scope of the `foo` function and thus does not affect the variable in the global scope.
