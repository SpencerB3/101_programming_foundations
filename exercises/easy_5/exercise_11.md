# You are given a method named spin_me that takes a string as an argument and returns a string that contains the same words, but with each word's characters reversed. Given the method's implementation, will the returned string be the same object as the one passed in as an argument or a different object?
# 

```Ruby
def spin_me(str)
  str.split.each do |word|
    word.reverse!
  end.join(" ")
end

spin_me("hello world") # "olleh dlrow"
```

Because the `split` method is called on the argument (converting the string to an array), the method will return a different object from the argument that was originally passed in.
