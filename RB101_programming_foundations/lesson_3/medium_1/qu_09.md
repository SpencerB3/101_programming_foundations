# Question 9

Consider these two simple methods:

```Ruby
def foo(param = "no")
  "yes"
end

def bar(param = "no")
  param == "no" ? "yes" : "no"
end
```

What would be the return value of the following method invocation?

`bar(foo)`

Answer:

`no` since foo always returns `"yes"`, and in the `bar` method anything not a `no` equals a `no`
