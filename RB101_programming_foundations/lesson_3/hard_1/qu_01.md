# Question 1

What do you expect to happen when the greeting variable is referenced in the last line of the code below?

```Ruby
if true
  greeting = “hello world”
end

greeting
```

Solution:
The variable `greeting` evaluates to `nil`.  When a variable is initialized in an `if` block, the variable is stored as `nil` in the local (in this case global) scope.
