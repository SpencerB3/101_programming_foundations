### Practice Problem 8
What happens when we modify an array while we are iterating over it? What would be output by this code?

```Ruby
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
numbers.each do |number|
  p number
  numbers.shift(1)
end
```
What would be output by this code?

```Ruby
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
numbers.each do |number|
  p number
  numbers.pop(1)
end
```
First one
`1`
`3
Second one
`1`
`2
`
As per a TA's advice, I typed out a `while` loop to help illustrate how these two code examples work.

```Ruby
index = 0
while index < numbers.size
  p numbers[index]
  p "#{index}  #{numbers.inspect}  #{numbers[index]}"
  numbers.shift(1)
  index += 1
end
```
Result:
```Ruby
"0  [1, 2, 3, 4]  1"
"1  [2, 3, 4]  3"
```

These two examples only iterate twice because they are working on the current length of the array, not the original one.  There cannot be a third iteration when the `each` method has alraedy passed over the first two indices.
