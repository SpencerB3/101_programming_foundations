#### Practice Problem 4

What is the return value of the following statement? Why?

```js
['ant', 'bear', 'caterpillar'].pop().length
```

The return value of the above statement is `11`.  The `array.prototype.pop()` removes the last element from the calling array.  The `length` property is then accessed which will return the number of characters in the string `catepillar`.
