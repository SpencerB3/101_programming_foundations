#### Practice Problem 5

What is the callback's return value in the following code? Also, what is the return value of `every` in this code?

```js
[1, 2, 3].every(num => {
  return num = num * 2;
});
```

The return values of the callback will be `2`, `4`, and `6` per each iteration.  Since all of these values are truthy, the return value of `every` will be `true`.
