#### Practice Problem 3

The following code differs slightly from the above code. What is the return value of `map` in this case? Why?

```js
[1, 2, 3].map(num => num * num);
```

The return value for the code above is `[1, 3, 9]`.  The reason the return value is different from the code in the last problem is because when the callback function is a single line expression (without braces) then the callback h an implicit return statement.
