#### Practice Problem 1

What is the return value of the `filter` method call below? Why?

```js
[1, 2, 3].filter(num => 'hi');
```

The return value of the code above will be `[1, 2, 3]`.  The reason for this is that the `filter` method evaluates the truthiness of the return value.  Being that the string `hi` always evaluates to a truthy value, `filter` will return a new array will all the elements of the original array.
