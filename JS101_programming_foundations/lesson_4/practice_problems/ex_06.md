#### Practice Problem 6

How does `Array.prototype.fill` work? Is it destructive? How can we find out?

```js
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
arr.fill(1, 1, 5);
```

The `Array.prototype.fill`method takes three arguments.  The first is a value, the second is a start index, and the third is an end index.  The `fill` method will then replace all the elements with the given value in between the two indices provided.  The `fill` method is destructive as  the value of `arr` is now `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.
