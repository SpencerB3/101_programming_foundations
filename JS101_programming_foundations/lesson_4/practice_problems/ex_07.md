#### Practice Problem 7

What is the return value of `map` in the following code? Why?

```js
['ant', 'bear'].map(elem => {
  if (elem.length > 3) {
    return elem;
  }
});
```

The return value for the above code is `[undefined, bear]`.  In the first iteration, the return value of the callback function returns `undefined` since there is no returned value.  The return value of the second iteration is the string from the original array.  The return value of the `map` method is therefore the new array `[undefined, bear]`.
