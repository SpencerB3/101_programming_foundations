#### Question 4

What will the following code output?

```javascript
let arr1 = [{ first: "value1" }, { second: "value2" }, 3, 4, 5];
let arr2 = arr1.slice();
arr2[0].first = 42;
console.log(arr1);
```

  The code above will log `[{ first: "value1" }, { second: "value2" }, 3, 4, 5]`.  Arrays are passed by reference in JavaScript, and therefore the assignment on line 2 (array.prototype.slice performs a shallow copy) binds the two variables to the same object.  Any change, like the one on line 3, will effect the value to which both `arr1` and `arr2` point.
