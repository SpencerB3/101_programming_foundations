#### Question 3

What will the following code output?

```javascript
let str1 = "hello there";
let str2 = str1;
str2 = "goodbye!";
console.log(str1)
```

 The code above will log `"hello there"` to the console.  Because strings in JavaScript are passed by value, the assignment of `str2` only gives `str2` a copy of the string to which `str1` points.  Therefore the reassignment of  `str2` on line 3 does not affect the value of `str1`.
