What will the following two lines of code output?

```javascript
console.log(0.3 + 0.6);
console.log(0.3 + 0.6 === 0.9);
```

The first line of code will log `0.89999999999`.  The second line of code will log `false`.  The JavaScript's floating point representations lack precision and give back unpredictable results.
