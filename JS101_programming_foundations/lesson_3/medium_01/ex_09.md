#### Question 9

Method calls can take expressions as arguments. Suppose we define a function called `rps` as follows, which follows the classic rules of the rock-paper-scissors game, but with a slight twist: in the event of a tie, it awards the win to the first of the two fists.

```javascript
function rps(fist1, fist2) {
  if (fist1 === "rock") {
    return fist2 === "paper" ? "paper" : "rock";
  } else if (fist1 === "paper") {
    return fist2 === "scissors" ? "scissors" : "paper";
  } else {
    return fist2 === "rock" ? "rock" : "scissors";
  }
}
```

What is the result of the following call?

```javascript
console.log(rps(rps(rps("rock", "paper"), rps("rock", "scissors")), "rock"));
```



The result of the above call is `paper`.  The two most inner calls result in `paper`and `rock`, with `paper` winning out between the two of them. The argument  `paper` then is evaluated against the outer `rock` argument.  The argument `paper` is then the final winner.
