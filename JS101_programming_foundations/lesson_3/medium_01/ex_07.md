#### Question 7

What is the output of the following code?

```javascript
let answer = 42;

function messWithIt(someNumber) {
  return (someNumber += 8);
}

let newAnswer = messWithIt(answer);

console.log(answer - 8);
```



The above code will log `34` to the console.  The reassignment which occurs in the function `messWithIt` with the variable `answer` as the argument (which then is assigned to the variable `newAnswer`) does not mutate the value of  the variable `answer` as numbers are immutable in JavaScript.
