#### Question 6

What do you think the following code will output?

```javascript
let nanArray = [NaN];

console.log(nanArray[0] === NaN);
```

**Bonus:**

How can you reliably test if a value is `NaN`?

The above code will return `false`.  `NaN` is a value that indicates that an operation that was supposed to return a number failed, as in `5 / 'five' `, i.e. a number divided by a string.

To reliably test if a value is `NaN`, use the `isNaN()` function.
