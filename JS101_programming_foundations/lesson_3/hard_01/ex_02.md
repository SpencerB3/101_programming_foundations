#### Question 2

What does the last line in the following code output?

```javascript
let object = { first: [1] };
let numArray = object["first"];
numArray.push(2);

console.log(numArray); //  => "[1, 2]"
console.log(object);
```

The last line of the code above will output `{ first: [1, 2] }`.  Because objects are mutable in JavaScript and the `Array.prototype.push()` method modifies the array to which `numArray` refers, the value of the key `first` inside the object `object` is also modified.
