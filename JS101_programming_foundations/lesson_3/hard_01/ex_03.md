#### Question 3

Given the following similar sets of code, what will each code snippet print?

A)

```javascript
function messWithVars(one, two, three) {
  one = two;
  two = three;
  three = one;
}

let one = ["one"];
let two = ["two"];
let three = ["three"];

messWithVars(one, two, three);

console.log(`one is: ${one}`);
console.log(`two is: ${two}`);
console.log(`three is: ${three}`);
```

The reassignment in the function `messWithVars` is not destructive.  Therefore, the code above will log:

```javascriipt
one is: one
two is: two
three is: three
```

B)

```javascript
function messWithVars(one, two, three) {
  one = ["two"];
  two = ["three"];
  three = ["one"];
}

let one = ["one"];
let two = ["two"];
let three = ["three"];

messWithVars(one, two, three);

console.log(`one is: ${one}`);
console.log(`two is: ${two}`);
console.log(`three is: ${three}`);
```

As in example A, the reassignment in the function `messWithVars` is not destructive.  The code above will log:

```
one is: one
two is: two
three is: three
```

C)

```javascript
function messWithVars(one, two, three) {
  one.splice(0, 1, "two");
  two.splice(0, 1, "three");
  three.splice(0, 1, "one");
}

let one = ["one"];
let two = ["two"];
let three = ["three"];

messWithVars(one, two, three);

console.log(`one is: ${one}`);
console.log(`two is: ${two}`);
console.log(`three is: ${three}`);
```

The `Array.prototype.splice()` method inside the `messWithVars` will mutate the object.  Therefore, the code above will log:

```
one is: two
two is: three
three is: one
```
