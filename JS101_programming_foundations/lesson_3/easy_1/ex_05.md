#### Question 5

What will the following code output?

```javascript
console.log(false == '0');
console.log(false === '0');
```

The first line of the above code will log `true`.  The nonstrict equality operator  `==` will coerce the string `'0'` to a `0`, and then evaluate the `0` to false.

The second line of code will log `false`.  The strict equality operator will evaluate the boolean `false` as not being equal to the string `'0'`.
