# Using the Card class from the previous exercise, create a Deck class that contains all of the standard 52 playing cards. The Deck class should provide a #draw method to deal one card. The Deck should be shuffled when it is initialized and, if it runs out of cards, it should reset itself by generating a new set of 52 shuffled cards. 

# Note that the last line should almost always be true; if you shuffle the deck 1000 times a second, you will be very, very, very old before you see two consecutive shuffles produce the same results. If you get a false result, you almost certainly have something wrong.
