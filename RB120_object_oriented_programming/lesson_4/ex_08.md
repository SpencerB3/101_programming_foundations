You can see in the `make_one_year_older` method we have used `self`. What does `self` refer to here?

```ruby
class Cat
  attr_accessor :type, :age

  def initialize(type)
    @type = type
    @age  = 0
  end

  def make_one_year_older
    self.age += 1
  end
end
```

The use of `self` inside the instance method `make_one_year_older` refers to the instance object that calls the method.
