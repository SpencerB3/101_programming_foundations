What is the result of the following:

```ruby
class Oracle
  def predict_the_future
    "You will " + choices.sample
  end

  def choices
    ["eat a nice lunch", "take a nap soon", "stay at work late"]
  end
end

class RoadTrip < Oracle
  def choices
    ["visit Vegas", "fly to Fiji", "romp in Rome"]
  end
end

trip = RoadTrip.new
puts trip.predict_the_future
```

"You will" plus any of the three string elements in the `choice` method contained in the `Roadtrip` class definition. Everytime Ruby searches for a method name, it first starts with the methods defined in the class within which the method is called.

"You will <some trip>"
