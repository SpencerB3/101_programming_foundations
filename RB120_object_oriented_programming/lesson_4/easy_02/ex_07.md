Explain what the `@@cats_count` variable does and how it works. What code would you need to write to test your theory?

```ruby
class Cat
  @@cats_count = 0

  def initialize(type)
    @type = type
    @age  = 0
    @@cats_count += 1
  end

  def self.cats_count
    @@cats_count
  end
end
```

The `@@cats_count` method variable is incremented by `1` at every object instantiation.  Therefore the method variable counts how many classes have been. created.   We can acess the `@@cats_count`variable using the Class method `self::cats_count`

Example:

```ruby
>> big_cat = Cat.new('female')
=> #<Cat:0x00007fa817164010 @type="female", @age=0>
>> Cat.cats_count
=> 1
>> little_cat = Cat.new('male')
=> #<Cat:0x00007fa817176198 @type="male", @age=0>
>> Cat.cats_count
=> 2
```
