Which one of these is a class method (if any) and how do you know? How would you call a class method?

```ruby
class Television
  def self.manufacturer
    # method logic
  end

  def model
    # method logic
  end
end
```

`self.manufacturer` is a class method because of the prefix `self`. 

You may call this method with the Class name appended with the method name.	

`Television.manufacturer`
