How do you find where Ruby will look for a method when that method is called? How can you find an object's ancestors?  What is the lookup chain for `Orange` and `HotSauce`?

```ruby
module Taste
  def flavor(flavor)
    puts "#{flavor}"
  end
end

class Orange
  include Taste
end

class HotSauce
  include Taste
end
```

You can call `ancestors` on the class.  For example:

```ruby
>> HotSauce.ancestors
=> [HotSauce, Taste, Object, Kernel, BasicObject]

>> Orange.ancestors
=> [Orange, Taste, Object, Kernel, BasicObject]
```
