What are the benefits of using Object Oriented Programming in Ruby? Think of as many as you can.

1. Allows programmers to maintain the growing complexity of a program.
2. Allows programmers to change code without having to think about the effects on the entire program.
3. Allows programs to encapsulate code so that the proggram would interact in small parts rather then full depency of every line with every other line.
4. Allows programmers to think of objects as nows and thus more easily conceprualize more easily.

Launch School Answer:

1. Creating objects allows programmers to think more abstractly about the code they are writing.
2. Objects are represented by nouns so are easier to conceptualize.
3. It allows us to only expose functionality to the parts of code that need it, meaning namespace issues are much harder to come across.
4. It allows us to easily give functionality to different parts of an application without duplication.
5. We can build applications faster as we can reuse pre-written code.
6. As the software becomes more complex this complexity can be more easily managed.
