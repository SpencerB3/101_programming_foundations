If we have the class below, what would you need to call to create a new instance of this class.

```ruby
class Bag
  def initialize(color, material)
    @color = color
    @material = material
  end
end
```

We would need `Bag.new` plus two arguments for `color` and `material`.

For example:

`new_bag = Bag.new('leather', 'brown')`
