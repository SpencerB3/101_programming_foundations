# Building on the prior vehicles question, we now must also track a basic motorboat. A motorboat has a single propeller and hull, but otherwise behaves similar to a catamaran. Therefore, creators of Motorboat instances don't need to specify number of hulls or propellers. How would you modify the vehicles code to incorporate a new Motorboat class?

module Moveable
  attr_accessor :speed, :heading
  attr_writer :fuel_capacity, :fuel_efficiency
  
  def range
    @fuel_capacity * @fuel_efficiency
  end
end

class SeaCraft
  include Moveable

  attr_reader :propeller_count, :hull_count

  def initialize(num_propellers, num_hulls, km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity)
    @propeller_count = num_propellers
    @hull_count = num_hulls
    self.km_traveled_per_liter = km_traveled_per_liter
    self.liters_of_fuel_capacity = liters_of_fuel_capacity
  end
end

class Motorboat < SeaCraft
  def initialize(km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity)
    super(1, 1, km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity)
  end
end

class Catamaran < SeaCraft
end
