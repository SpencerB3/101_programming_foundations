What is the default return value of `to_s` when invoked on an object? Where could you go to find out if you want to be sure?

The `to_s` method will return the name of the object's class as well as the object id.  As example from the last exercise would be `#<Cube:0x00007fb61c932d88>`.

You may find this in any Ruby documentation online.  For example:
