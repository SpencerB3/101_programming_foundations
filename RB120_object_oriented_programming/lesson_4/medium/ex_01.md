Ben asked Alyssa to code review the following code:

```ruby
class BankAccount
  attr_reader :balance

  def initialize(starting_balance)
    @balance = starting_balance
  end

  def positive_balance?
    balance >= 0
  end
end
```

Alyssa glanced over the code quickly and said - "It looks fine, except that you forgot to put the `@` before `balance` when you refer to the balance instance variable in the body of the `positive_balance?` method."

"Not so fast", Ben replied. "What I'm doing here is valid - I'm not missing an `@`!"

Who is right, Ben or Alyssa, and why?

Answer: Ben is correct.  It is not necessary to prepend an `@` to `balance` inside the body of the `positive_balance?` Method.  The reason is that `balance` refers to the getter method initialized at the top rather than the instance variable `@balance` initialized in the `initialize` method.
