  When we called the go_fast method from an instance of the Car class (as shown below) you might have noticed that the string printed when we go fast includes the name of the type of vehicle we are using. How is this done?

```ruby
module Speed
  def go_fast
    puts "I am a #{self.class} and going super fast!"
  end
end

class Car
  include Speed
  def go_slow
    puts "I am safe and driving slow."
  end
end

small_car = Car.new
small_car.go_fast  # => I am a Car and going super fast!
```

  Inside `Speed::go_fast` there is string interpolation that contains `self.class`.  The `self` part refers to the object itself.  We then ask the .class to tell us the class.  The result is then transformed into part of the string by the interpolation.
