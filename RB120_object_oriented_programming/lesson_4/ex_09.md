In the name of the `cats_count` method we have used `self`. What does `self` refer to in this context?

```ruby
class Cat
  @@cats_count = 0

  def initialize(type)
    @type = type
    @age  = 0
    @@cats_count += 1
  end

  def self.cats_count
    @@cats_count
  end
end
```

We have prepended the instance method `cats_count` with `self` in order to define the method as a class method.  `self` itself reprsents the class itself `Cat`.
